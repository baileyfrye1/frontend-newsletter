## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This challenge was a great chance to practice a success page for email submissions. This is something I have yet to create for a website so it was good practice to understand some of how they work and a potential way to implement them.

Throughout this challenge I got to practice more form validation, more precise layouts, mobile-first design, and dynamically replacing content.

This was my first time dynamically replacing an image based on page width by using an event listener on the window itself, I'm excited to find more applications with the resize event listener on the window for my past projects.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to practice email success screens as I don't believe my solution would be the most applicable for a live site. I'm excited to practice more form validation and practicing replacing content dynamically with javascript.
